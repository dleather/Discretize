This package contains Matlab code to approximate AR(1) process with discrete Markov chain, using the methods suggested by Tauchen (1986) and Tauchen and Hussey (1991). The code also replicates the results in M. Floden (2007), "A Note on the Accuracy of Markov-Chain Approximations to Highly Persistent AR(1)-Processes".

The following files are included in the package (see these files for further details and instructions):

TAUCHEN.M            generates an AR(1) process using Tauchen's (Ec. Letters, 1986) method
TAUCHENHUSSEY.M      generates an AR(1) process using Tauchen and Hussey's (Econometrica, 1991) method
ADDACOOPER.M         generates an AR(1) process using Adda and Cooper's (Dynamic Economics, 2003) method

EVALUATE_METHODS.M   evaluates the approximations implied by these methods
